...This Udacity project helped me learn how to be a detective. I tracked where changes are to be made and how to integrate them seamlessly with code thatâ€™s already there..
The following are changes I've made:
..1. Add a priority button 
..2. Add an edit button 
..3. Add "-- Done!" when a task is marked as done.
