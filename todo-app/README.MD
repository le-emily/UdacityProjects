This Udacity project helped me learn how to be a detective. I tracked where changes are to be made and how to integrate them seamlessly with code thatâ€™s already there.
The following are changes I've made:
** Add a priority button 
** Add an edit button 
** Add "-- Done!" when a task is marked as done.
